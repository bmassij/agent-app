# Roadmap
# Cursor Mobile Commander

---

## Vision

A native mobile app that makes Cursor Background Agents as easy to use as sending a WhatsApp message. Create, monitor, review, and merge — entirely from your phone.

---

## v1.0 — Foundation (Target: 6 weeks from kickoff)

The minimum viable product for a single user managing their own Cursor agents.

**Included:**
- Cursor API key setup (paste + QR scan)
- GitHub OAuth connect
- Pin multiple repositories
- Create new agents with prompt + options
- Real-time chat streaming (SSE)
- Follow-up prompts to existing agents
- Cancel running agents
- Background polling + local notifications on completion
- View token usage per run
- PR list, diff viewer, approve, merge, delete branch
- Repository file browser
- Command templates (8 built-in + custom)
- Conversation history (SQLite persistence)
- Offline read mode + prompt queue
- Dark theme
- Android release (Play Store)

**Not included in v1.0:**
- iOS App Store (TestFlight only)
- Multi-account support
- Tablet / landscape layout
- Team / multi-user support

---

## v1.1 — iOS Production (Target: +2 weeks)

- iOS App Store submission
- iOS-specific biometric (Face ID)
- iOS background fetch for notifications
- iOS app switcher blur

---

## v1.2 — Productivity (Target: +4 weeks)

- Full-text search across conversation history
- Export conversation as Markdown
- Agent tagging / labeling (local)
- Tablet layout (split-pane: projects left, chat right)
- Voice input (speech_to_text)
- Image attach to prompts
- Artifacts viewer (screenshots, logs)

---

## v1.3 — GitHub Power Features (Target: +4 weeks)

- CI/CD status detail view (logs per step)
- Branch comparison view
- Inline comment on PR diff
- Multiple merge method support (squash, rebase, merge)
- Draft PR support
- GitHub Issues list (read + create)

---

## v2.0 — Team Mode (Target: +12 weeks, requires backend)

When a backend is added:
- GitHub App integration (higher rate limits, fine-grained permissions)
- Push notifications via FCM (not polling)
- Multi-user workspace
- Agent assignment (create agent; assign to team member for review)
- Webhook-driven real-time updates
- Usage dashboard (tokens per user, per project, per week)
- Agent audit log (who started what, when, what merged)

---

## Future Ideas (Unscheduled)

- Cursor agent marketplace (community templates)
- Watch app companion (approve PR from watch)
- Desktop menu bar companion (macOS)
- GitLab / Bitbucket support (when Cursor supports alternative VCS)
- Self-hosted Cursor support (enterprise)

---
